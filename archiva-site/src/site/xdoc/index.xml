      <p>
         Archiva is a build artifact repository manager for use with
         build tools such as <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>,
         <a href="http://maven.apache.org/continuum/">Continuum</a>,
         and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ANT</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Archiva, you can share artifacts with other developers and manage the associated
        security required, aggregate (proxy) content from remote artifact repositories, visualise
        your artifact utilisation with search, browse and reporting, and perform routine
        maintenance on your repositories.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A place for like-minded developers to share artifacts
            that are private in nature, such as found in proprietary
            development shops.</li>
        <li>The ability to act as a nearby (proxy) cache of popular global
            repositories for better build performance.</li>
        <li>Secure your repositories!  by user, by role, by repository,
            read vs write access controls.</li>
        <li>A tool to browse the repository information, and present it

        <li>Implement controls on the artifacts that the developers
            in your organization use.</li>
