      <p>Archiva (the Maven repository manager) is currently under development. It provides several pieces of
        functionality for your remote repository:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Browsing on POM information by group and artifact ID</li>
          <li>Search over various information in the POM and filename</li>
          <li>Locate JAR by checksum</li>
          <li>Repository management through reporting and maintenance</li>
      </ul>

      <p> We welcome developers to the Maven community who are interested in contributing. If you'd like to discuss
        archiva, subscribe and post to <a href="mail-lists.html">the development mailing list</a>
        <code>archiva-dev@maven.apache.org</code>.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to obtain the code, you can get it from Subversion.
        See <a href="source-repository.html">SCM details</a> for more information.</p>

      <p>Bugs, issues and new ideas should be reported in the issue tracker -
        see <a href="issue-tracking.html">this page</a>.</p>
