          Archiva has utilities called consumers that can be used for maintaining the
          Archiva repositories. These can be configured or activated in the Repository
          Scanning section of the webapp. The configuration are stored in Archiva's
          xml configuration files, meaning you can also hand-edit these config files to
          enable or disable these consumers.
