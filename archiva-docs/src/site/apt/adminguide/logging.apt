Log Files

  To keep track of the Archiva performance and problems, log files are created during runtime.
  These files can be found in the <<<logs/>>> directory.
  
  * {{{./archiva-logs.html} <<archiva.log>>}} - contains all the start-up information and output logs for Archiva
  
  * {{{./audit-logs.html} <<archiva-audit.log>>}} - contains information regarding the operations performed against
                           the repositories and configurations being modified. A good example is when an artifact
                           is deployed to an Archiva repository. The operation will be logged in this file,
                           with the date and timestamp of when the operation occurred, the userId of who performed
                           the deployment, and the artifact that was deployed.
  
  * {{{./security-logs.html} <<archiva-security-audit.log>>}} - contains information regarding Archiva's security.
                            For example, a successful login of a user or a user account is created.
