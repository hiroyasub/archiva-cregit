Upgrading Archiva

   Upgrading Archiva is straightforward if the directions for separating the base from the installation above are followed. Simply retain the <<<data/repositories>>> and <<<data/databases/users>>> directories,
   and the configuration files (in the conf directory, or the other locations specified above) and use a new extracted installation of Archiva.

   Note that the <<<users>>> database must always be retained as it contains the permissions and user information across versions. However,
   in order to take advantage of the improvements in search in Archiva 1.1 (and higher versions), s.a. search by java class/package/method, the archiva database must
   be re-created. So you need to delete the <<<data/databases/archiva>>> directory, delete the <<<.index>>> directories of your respective repositories, and execute the repository and database scanners after
   starting Archiva.

   The repository data is portable across versions, and multiple versions can be configured to look at the same repositories (though not run simultaneously).

* Upgrading Archiva from 1.1 to 1.2

   Because of the changes in the search implementation in 1.2, a few additional steps need to be performed when upgrading Archiva from 1.x to
   1.2. Since the format of the index has changed in 1.2, the old index directory (which is located at <<</path/to/repo/.index>>> by default) needs to
   be removed. And in order for the artifacts in the repository to be indexed again, the last modified date of the artifacts need to be updated.
   To do this, just execute <<find [REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY_NAME] | xargs touch>> at the base directory where the repository resides. Execute the repository
   scanning so that the new index will be generated.
