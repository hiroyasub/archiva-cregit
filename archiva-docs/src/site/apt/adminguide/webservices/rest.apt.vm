Using REST Services

  Starting version 1.4, you can use some REST Services to manage your Apache Archiva instance and Search artifacts.
  All samples here will use Apache CXF REST client API. By the way you can use some others REST client frameworks.
  NOTE: a wadl is available in your Archiva instance : http(s)://ip:port/..//restServices/application.wadl

* Search Service

   Authentication headers for connect to your Archiva instance :

   Get a Search Service Client :

   Quick Search

   Search Artifacts Version : to search all availables version with a groupId and artifactId and packaging (if empty jar is used)

  Search Service with a classifier :

  Search Service with a classifier :

%{snippet|id=searchservice-with-classifier|url=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/archiva/trunk/archiva-modules/archiva-web/archiva-rest/archiva-rest-services/src/test/java/org/apache/archiva/rest/services/SearchServiceTest.java}

  Copy Artifact from a repository to an other one :

  For some reasons you want to use a test repository before moving your artifacts to a repository used by final users.
  To achieve this, you can use a service which can copy an artifact from a repository to an other one

%{snippet|id=copy-artifact-with-classifier|url=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/archiva/trunk/archiva-modules/archiva-web/archiva-rest/archiva-rest-services/src/test/java/org/apache/archiva/rest/services/CopyArtifactTest.java}


  To know all the possible options, you can refer to the javadoc of SearchRequest class.
