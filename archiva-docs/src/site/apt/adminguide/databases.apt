Apache Archiva Databases

  Archiva uses an external database for two purposes:

    * Storing artifact information

    * As a default user store for security

    []

  Generally, it is unnecessary to configure anything - the built in embedded database is suitable for the artifact management, and if
  an external authentication mechanism is not needed, the user database.

  However, it is possible to configure an external database as needed.

* Configuring an external database

  Archiva uses JNDI data sources to locate the databases to use:

    * <<<jdbc/archiva>>> - the repository database

    * <<<jdbc/users>>> - the user store

  Configuring an external database for either or both of these sources depends is configured in <<<plexus.xml>>> if you are using the
  {{{standalone.html} standalone installation}}, or in the application server configuration if you are using the {{{webapp.html} web application
  installation}}.

* Backing up the database

  While it is a good idea to back up both databases, it is not strictly necessary to back up the repository database on a regular basis. Should any
  data loss be suffered, this database can be regenerated by deleting it's contents and re-scanning the repositories.

  If you are using the default user security mechanism, it is important to back up the users database on a regular basis to ensure that the user
  passwords and information are not lost in the event of corruption. With the default embedded storage this is simply a matter of making a copy of
  the database directory on the filesystem. If you have configured an external database as the source for user information, please refer to your
  database documentation for backup instructions.
