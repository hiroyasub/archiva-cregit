comment|/**  * This module provides an event mechanism for all archiva subsystems.  *  * The events are hierarchical organized. That means each subsystem has its own event manager that collects events  * and processes and forwards them to the parent event manager (normally the central event manager).  * Each event manager clones the event and stores the origin event in the chain before forwarding them to the parent manager.  *  * Event Types are also hierarchical. There is one special type {@link org.apache.archiva.event.EventType#ROOT} that is the  * root type and has no parent type. All other types must be descendants of the ROOT type.  *  * Event types may have certain methods to access context information. But context information can also be accessed in a  * subsystem independent way using the event context data. Event contexts provide access to data without using the  * subsystem API and classes.  * Event types may be used for filtering events.  *  * @since 3.0  * @author Martin Schreier<martin_s@apache.org>  */
